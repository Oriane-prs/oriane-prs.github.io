In November 2024, I participated to the panel discussion on how to guarantee that barriers at universities are sustainably dismantled as well as how to anchor intersectional knowledge in Swiss higher education institutions.
I provided expertise in digital accessibility and inclusion of students with disabilities in higher education. I notably highlighted the importance of raising awareness among all university stakeholders and pointed out the 
importance of holding all actors responsible for inclusion and equality.
