In April 2023, I gave a keynote talk at the University Future Festival in Heilbronn (Germany) on the [opportunities and risks of using AI Edtech for students with disabilities (recording on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LHOekz6_xU). This talk was partially based on results from a scoping review I am currently revising. 
During the event, I also gave an [interview entitled "AI tools for students with disabilities" in German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEMRdjSYtZ0) with one of the co-organizers of the event KI Campus. In the interview, I explain how I imagine AI tools can be used in higher education to promote the inclusion of students with disabilities.
