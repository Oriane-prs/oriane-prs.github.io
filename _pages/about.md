Hi! I am a PhD candidate in artificial intelligence (AI) ethics at the [Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine (IBME)](https://www.ibme.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zurich and a [research assistant at the ZHAW School of Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/piee/). My primary supervisor is Prof. Dr. Alireza Darvishy and PD Dr. Markus Christen.

My research focuses in understanding how AI can impact the inclusion of students with disabilities in higher education. While many new technologies (e.g. writing assistants, automatic captioning, etc.) can enhance the autonomy of students and eleviate barriers in tertiary education, ethical issues such as bias, privacy breach, exclusion, low accuracy and alike can reduce their benefits. Identifying issues and critically reflecting on them should not lead to inaction, but a discussion towards solutions that work for everybody.
