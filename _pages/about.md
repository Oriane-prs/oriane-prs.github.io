Hi! I am post-doctoral research at the [Digital Society Initiative](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of ZÃ¼rich. In April 2025, I defended my doctoral thesis on the Use of Artificial Intelligence: The Perspective of Students with Disabilities at the [Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine (IBME)](https://www.ibme.uzh.ch/en.html) which was a collaboration with the ZHAW School of Engineering in Winterthur. 

As part of the [AI Buddy project](https://www.ai-buddy.uzh.ch/en.html), my research aims to better understand how to design and implement an AI assistant in higher education in an inclusive manner. While many new technologies (e.g. writing assistants, automatic captioning, etc.) can enhance the autonomy of students and eleviate barriers in tertiary education, ethical issues such as bias, privacy breach, exclusion, low accuracy and alike can reduce their benefits. Identifying issues and critically reflecting on them should not lead to inaction, but a discussion towards solutions that work for everybody. 

Are you interested in doing research on AI and digital accessibility and/or diversity in higher education? Are you looking for an additional supervisor for your thesis?
